<div id="sidebarright">
	<h2>Another Sidebar</h2>
	<p>
	Sure, why not?! With all this width we have room for an additional sidebar if you should so need one.
	</p>

	<p>
	Of course, if you happen to not want this additional sidebar, a standard 2 column layout is available which you can view by <a href="twocolumns.html">clicking here</a>!
